                        By integrating the strengths of the Montessori and Early Years curriculum in our early years' classes, we have created a rich set of coursework that nurtures our students' innate curiosity, develops independence, and enables them to explore their potential while learning at their own pace. 

                        The daily schedule is enriched through the inclusion of language studies, drama, art, ballet, and music (piano and violin lessons). 

                        We currently have programs for toddlers, preschoolers, kindergarten students, primary school students, and junior high students. Admissions are on a rolling basis, provided there are slots available.

                        The school day concludes at 3:30 p.m., but the learning does not! We have several enrichment programs designed to meet your childâ€™s interests and talents.
                        After-school programs are available to children aged 3 and up and run from 4 to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.
                        Ballet, coding, art club, drum club, piano, and folklore club are currently available. Look out for more, as we hope to offer new and exciting programs with time!
